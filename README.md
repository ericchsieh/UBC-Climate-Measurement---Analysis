# UBC-Climate-Measurement-And-Analysis
Data Analysis Final Project and a collection of lab assignments.

### Learning Objectives
- Conduct science research based on observations and data collected in the class
- Consider scale and scale dependence of environmental phenomena, and how those are reflected in environmental information.
- Appreciate the effort, potential errors and problems in collecting long-term environmental time series.
- Refine your use of PRECISE scientific terminology to describe your data, your question(s) and your outcomes.
- Find, assess and use publicly available data to critically and quantitatively evaluate scientific ideas.
- Apply the concepts of statistical significance, anomalies, correlation, trends, periodicity, variance and co-variance using common computational techniques.
- Critically evaluate scientific statements
- Communicate science visually and orally
- Work effectively as part of a group


## Final Project
#### Topic: "Correlation Analysis of ENSO Effects on Sea Surface Temperature and Ocean pH: A Comparative Study of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (1989-2014)"

#### Key Points
- El Ni単o and La Ni単a Impacts: El Ni単o typically causes warming of surface waters and a reduction in nutrient-rich upwelling, while La Ni単a results in cooler surface temperatures. Both phenomena affect marine ecosystems, which is why understanding their impact on SST and pH is crucial.

- Ocean Acidification: You effectively highlight the increasing atmospheric CO2 and its role in ocean acidification, which lowers the pH of ocean water and affects marine life, especially corals and shell-forming organisms.

- Methodology: The use of Pearson's correlation coefficient to measure the strength and direction of relationships between SST, pH, and ENSO is appropriate for this type of analysis. The interpretation of the coefficients follows the standard guidelines.

#### Results Summary
Hawaii SST and pH: SST at Hawaii showed a statistically significant increase over time, while ocean pH decreased significantly. This suggests that ocean acidification is a major issue in the Pacific region. The relationship between SST and pH in Hawaii, however, was not statistically significant.

Bermuda SST and pH: In Bermuda, SST did not show a significant trend over time, but ocean pH showed a significant decrease, though less steep than in Hawaii.

ENSO and Correlations:

The correlation between SST and ENSO in both regions was found to be negligible, which is somewhat unexpected, especially for Hawaii, where ENSO effects are usually pronounced.
The correlation between ENSO and pH in Hawaii was moderately positive and statistically significant, indicating that ENSO may influence pH levels.
In Bermuda, the correlation between ENSO and pH was weaker and not statistically significant.
