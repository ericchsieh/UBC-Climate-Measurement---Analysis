# Final Project

### "Correlation Analysis of ENSO Effects on Sea Surface Temperature and Ocean pH: A Comparative Study of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans (1989-2014)"

### Key Points
- El Niño and La Niña Impacts: El Niño generally causes warming of surface waters and reduces nutrient-rich upwelling, while La Niña leads to cooler surface temperatures. Both phenomena significantly affect marine ecosystems, making it essential to understand their influence on sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean pH levels.

- Ocean Acidification: Increasing atmospheric CO2 has led to rising ocean acidity, resulting in a lower pH that poses challenges for marine life, particularly coral reefs and shell-forming organisms. This project highlights the ongoing trend of ocean acidification and its potential ecological consequences.
  
- Methodology: Pearson’s correlation coefficient was used to measure the strength and direction of the relationships between SST, ocean pH, and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This statistical approach offers valuable insights into how these variables interact over time.

### Results Summary
- Hawaii SST and pH: In Hawaii, sea surface temperature exhibited a significant upward trend, while ocean pH showed a statistically significant decrease, underscoring the severity of ocean acidification in the Pacific. However, no statistically significant relationship between SST and pH was observed.

- Bermuda SST and pH: In Bermuda, SST did not display a significant trend over time, but pH levels decreased significantly, although at a slower rate compared to Hawaii.

- ENSO and Correlations
  - The correlation between ENSO and SST in both Hawaii and Bermuda was negligible, which contrasts with expectations, particularly for Hawaii, where ENSO typically has a pronounced influence.
  - A moderately positive and statistically significant correlation was observed between ENSO and ocean pH in Hawaii, suggesting ENSO may influence pH levels.
  - In Bermuda, the correlation between ENSO and pH was weaker and not statistically significant.

### Discussion of Unexpected Results
The correlation between ENSO and pH is positive, rather than the expected negative relationship, raises interesting questions. This suggests that there may be more complex interactions between atmospheric CO2, temperature changes, and ocean chemistry than previously understood. Additionally, the lack of a strong correlation between ENSO and SST is unexpected, especially in Hawaii, which is more directly influenced by ENSO-driven ocean circulation patterns.

### Recommendations for Further Research:
1. Deeper Analysis of Ocean Circulation: Given the unexpected results, especially regarding ENSO and SST, further investigation into the specific oceanographic conditions at HOTS (Hawaii) and BATS (Bermuda) during ENSO events may be necessary. Examining the influence of other factors such as regional wind patterns or local ocean currents could shed light on these correlations.

2. Impact on Marine Life: As ocean acidification trends continue, future research should focus on the ecological effects in both regions, particularly how coral reefs and carbonate-dependent organisms are affected.

3. Multivariate Analysis: Incorporating additional variables such as CO2 concentration, nutrient levels, and other climate indices through a multivariate approach could offer more detailed insights into the complex interactions between ocean temperature, pH, and ENSO.
